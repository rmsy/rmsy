### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer living in Fort Worth, Texas.

I'm currently a Lead Software Developer at [@sixflags](https://github.com/sixflags), and I previously worked with code at [@OvercastNetwork](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork).

I am actively looking for new opportunities, and am especially interested in companies working in education or social good.

I have experience with the technologies below:
- JS, TypeScript, React.js
- AWS (Lambda, Kinesis, ECS, CloudFormation/CDK)
- C#, ASP.NET, MS SQL
- Ruby on Rails
- Docker

I would love to get in touch. Check out my [resume](https://isaacmoore.me/Isaac%20Moore%20Resume.pdf), and then [say hi](mailto:im@isaacmoore.me)!
